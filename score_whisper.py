"""
score_whisper.py  -  Phase 5: score every output with speech recognition.

Transcribes the WAV files from sim_conversation_out/ with Whisper (running locally
on your CPU) and computes word error rate (WER) against what was actually said.
Lower WER = better. 0% = perfect, 100% = nothing right (it can exceed 100%
when the recognizer adds extra words, e.g. from the other speaker leaking in).

Install once:  pip install faster-whisper jiwer
Run:           python score_whisper.py            (base.en model, ~150 MB download on first run)
               python score_whisper.py small.en   (bigger, slower, more accurate)
Output:        results/wer_results.csv and results/transcripts.txt
