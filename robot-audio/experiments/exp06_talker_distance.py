"""
Experiment 6 (Phase 1): how far away can the talkers be?
Same room, array and directions; only the talker distance changes.
Farther talkers are quieter relative to the room echo (past the critical
distance the reverberant sound dominates), so direction finding and
beamforming should both get worse.

Run from the robot-audio folder:  python experiments/exp06_talker_distance.py
Results: results/exp06_talker_distance/
